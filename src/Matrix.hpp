/**
 * @brief Represents a two-dimensional matrix, to be used for linear algebra.
 * @author Your Name (youruniqname)
 * @detail Matrix is, essentially, a simplified version of an `Eigen::Matrix`.
 * 		It's capable of element-wise arithmetic, supports basic matrix math
 * 		operations, and has a few utility functions to make it easier to use.
 *
 * 		Matrix "has-a(n)" Array2D that acts as its internal representation
 * 		of its contents. This is hidden from the user (i.e. us, when we're
 * 		writing executables to test your code, and you, when you're writing
 * 		your test cases).
 *
 * 		In the real world, you could change this to something else (maybe you
 * 		want to just use a native 2D array for sake of simplicity), and as long
 * 		as you **don't change the public interface** (i.e. as long as row-column
 * 		indexing still returns the element at the correct row and column, and
 * 		so on), none of the code that uses `Matrix` would have to change.
 *
 * 		(They'll spend a few lectures talking about that in EECS280. This
 * 		concept is called **procedural abstraction**.)
 *
 * 		Note that **all of the methods below** should throw
 * 		`std::runtime_error`s if invoked upon a "blank" matrix (i.e. a
 * 		matrix whose `contents` pointer is a `nullptr`).
