To clone this project, run the command:

		git clone https://github.com/maavumich/project3

...in a terminal. This will create a directory in the present working
directory ("`PWD`") called `project3` that contains all of the files in
this repo.

# Training Project 3

Pointers, references, operator overloading, build systems, test-driven
development, and the Big Three. Third project in the core training sequence.

Trainees will implement a `Matrix` class supporting basic matrix
operations. Trainees will make use of test-driven development and practice
working with some of the libraries and systems used by MAAV software
developers.

Instructions and pass requirements are found in the `./docs` folder.

**To jump to a file in vim, move your terminal cursor over the file or
directory in normal mode and type** `gf`.

**Type** `CTRL-^` **in normal mode to return to the previously-opened file.**

**See** `./docs/navigating_buffers.md` **for more information.**
